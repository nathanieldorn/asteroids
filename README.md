# Asteroids Project for Boot.dev
A guided project in Python using OOP.

## Instructions
- Move the ship with 'W', 'A', 'S', and 'D'.
  - W = forward
  - S = backwards
  - A = rotate left
  - D = rotate right
- Fire by pressing 'Space'.

## Added Features
The following feature(s) have been added beyond the assignment requirements.
- Phase shift: Temporarily phase into an alternate dimension, allowing you to pass through solid matter.
  - Bullets have no effect while phased.
  - The shift lasts for three seconds and turns your ship yellow.
  - It takes 30 seconds for the phase shift to recharge before it can be used again.
  - Activate by pressing 'F'.
- Warp jump: Quickly activate your warp engines to instantly jump to the opposite position on screen.
  - After a jump, your engines will glow red until they have cooled down, 15 seconds.
  - Another jump cannot be performed while the engines are overheated.
  - Activate by pressing 'Q'.
